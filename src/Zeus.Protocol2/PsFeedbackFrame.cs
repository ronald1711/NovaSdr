/// One 1024-sample paired feedback block destined for WDSP <c>psccF</c>.
/// TX side comes from the post-fexchange2 IQ tap inside Zeus's TXA pipeline
/// (forwarded over the network via DDC0 phase = TX freq) and the RX side is
/// the radio's feedback-coupler IQ on DDC1. Both arrive interleaved within
/// a single UDP packet on port 1035 when PS is armed (pihpsdr
/// <c>process_ps_iq_data</c>, <c>new_protocol.c:2463-2510</c>).
///
/// Block size is 1024 complex samples per pihpsdr <c>receiver.c:636</c> —
/// independent of Zeus's TX analyzer 2048-sample block. Do NOT share the
/// buffers across pumps; the calcc state machine demands its own sample
/// alignment.
///
/// SeqHint is the radio's UDP sequence at the start of the block, useful
/// for diagnostic logging when the cal converges slowly. Not used by WDSP.
