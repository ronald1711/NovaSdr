/* rnnr_stub.c — Zeus NR3 stub
 *
 * No-op replacement for rnnr.c used by the MVP build. Upstream rnnr.c
 * links against RNNoise; we defer that dependency and compile this file
 * instead (see native/wdsp/CMakeLists.txt, option WDSP_WITH_NR3_NR4).
 * Struct layout matches rnnr.h so that RXA.c's accesses — notably
 * `rxa[ch].rnnr.p->run` — remain well-defined. The `run` field stays
 * zero, so the NR3 path in RXA.c's ResCheck is never taken.
