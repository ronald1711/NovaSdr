/* sbnr_stub.c — Zeus NR4 stub

 * No-op replacement for sbnr.c used by the MVP build. Upstream sbnr.c
 * links against libspecbleach; we defer that dependency and compile this
 * file instead (see native/wdsp/CMakeLists.txt, option WDSP_WITH_NR3_NR4).
 * Struct layout matches sbnr.h so that RXA.c's accesses — notably
 * `rxa[ch].sbnr.p->run` — remain well-defined. `run` stays zero, so the
 * NR4 path is never taken.
