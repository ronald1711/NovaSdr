/// <summary>
/// One 1024-sample paired feedback block destined for WDSP <c>psccF</c>,
/// produced by <see cref="Protocol1Client"/> when the operator arms PS
/// against an HL2 + external coupler. Mirrors the shape of
/// <c>Zeus.Protocol2.PsFeedbackFrame</c> so the
/// DspPipelineService pump can treat both protocols uniformly.
///
/// On HL2 (this protocol) the TX-side reference is the operator's TX-IQ as
/// written to the radio's DUC (NOT a coupler tap — there isn't one on
/// HL2). The RX side comes from the dedicated feedback ADC (ADC1) routed
/// through DDC1 when the gateware honours <c>0x0a[22] = 1</c> and
/// MOX is asserted. See
/// docs/references/protocol-1/hermes-lite2-protocol.md "PureSignal
/// feedback path" for the wire mechanics.
///
/// SeqHint is the radio's EP6 sequence at the start of the block,
/// useful for diagnostic logging when the cal converges slowly. Not
/// used by WDSP.
