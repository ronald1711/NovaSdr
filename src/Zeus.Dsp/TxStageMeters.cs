/// <summary>
/// Per-block TXA stage readings sampled from the WDSP metering ring. Level
/// fields (*Pk/*Av) are dBFS; gain-reduction fields (*Gr) are positive dB
/// of reduction (0 = no reduction, 6 = 6 dB cut). When TXA is not processing
/// (MOX off, or engine lacks TXA), all level fields are
/// <see cref="float.NegativeInfinity"/> and all gain-reduction fields are 0.
///
/// Both peak and average are captured for each active stage. The operator
/// uses average to judge level and peak to spot clipping-induced distortion
/// that hides inside the average window's ~100 ms smoothing. Indices tracked
/// per <c>native/wdsp/TXA.h:49-66</c> txaMeterType.
///
/// Sign convention for *Gr fields: WDSP returns <c>TXA_*_GAIN</c> as
/// <c>20*log10(linear_gain)</c>, which is ≤ 0 when the stage is reducing.
/// Callers must negate before storing here so downstream consumers see a
/// monotonic "how much are we cutting?" scale.
///
/// CFC / COMP readings will sit at the WDSP silence sentinel (≈ −400 dBFS)
/// until their stages are engaged; the frontend treats the sentinel as
/// "bypassed" (P1.4 sentinel handling). Leaving the fields in the record
/// keeps the DSP→wire pipeline uniform regardless of which stages are on.
