// Per-radio quirks in how the drive-level byte actually makes it from
// Zeus to RF. Every HPSDR radio ostensibly speaks the same protocol 1 /
// protocol 2 wire format, but what each one DOES with the byte we put
// in C0=0x12, C1=drive_level varies:
//
//   - Hermes / ANAN-10 / ANAN-100 / Orion / G2  — use all 8 bits.
//     Fine-grained drive control; the classic Thetis/piHPSDR math
//     (target watts → dBm − PA gain → volts @ 50 Ω → byte/255 × 0.8 V)
//     maps cleanly to output power.
//
//   - Hermes-Lite 2 — reads ONLY bits [31:28] of the drive register.
//     The bottom nibble is silently discarded by the HL2 gateware.
//     That means the 8-bit byte the math produces is quantised to
//     one of 16 power steps. A "correct-looking" byte like 48
//     (from piHPSDR's generic pa_calibration=40.5 with 5 W rated PA)
//     lands in nibble 0x3 → 3/15 = 20 % of max drive, capping
//     output at 1–2 W no matter how precise the IQ or how correct
//     the packet rate. See docs/references/protocol-1/
//     hermes-lite2-protocol.md:51 and docs/lessons/
//     hl2-drive-byte-quantization.md.
//
// IMPORTANT for anyone touching TX / PA / drive-byte code:
//
//   Go through this abstraction. Do not hard-code an 8-bit linear
//   voltage model and expect it to "just work" on every board — it
//   won't on HL2, and the silence on the bench can eat a day before
//   you realise the bytes you're computing aren't the bytes the
//   radio is honouring. Add new board quirks by implementing
//   IRadioDriveProfile and extending RadioDriveProfiles.For.
//
// Reference implementations:
//   - piHPSDR radio.c:2809-2828 (8-bit, no HL2 quantisation — HL2
//     users happen to land drive high enough that nibble 0xF is
//     reached, which is why their "it works" setups work).
//   - Thetis console.cs:46801-46841 (8-bit, no HL2-specific branch).
//   - mi0bot/openhpsdr-thetis — HL2-specific fork; look there for
//     further HL2 quirks Zeus may need to mirror.
