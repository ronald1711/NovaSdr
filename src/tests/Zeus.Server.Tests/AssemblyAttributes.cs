// LiteDB v5's BsonMapper.Global is a process-wide static cache that is not
// thread-safe during the first GetEntityMapper(T) call for a given T. Two
// xUnit test classes constructing PaSettingsStore / DspSettingsStore /
// PsSettingsStore in parallel can race on populating PaBandEntry's field
// map and intermittently throw "Member Band not found on BsonMapper for
// type Zeus.Server.PaBandEntry" inside LiteCollection.EnsureIndex.
//
// Per-fixture temp DB paths (4a33523) only narrow the timing window — they
// don't remove the race because the mapper cache is global, not per-file.
// Production never hits this because the real radio runtime constructs the
// stores exactly once. Disabling class-level test parallelism for THIS
// assembly serializes those constructions and removes the race outright,
// at a measured cost of ~1s on a 200-test suite.
